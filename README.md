# My homepage
This is a training website created during a basic front-end course ["WTF: Co Ten Frontend"](https://cotenfrontend.pl).
It contains all important information from this course grouped in articles, as well as many useful links and terminal commands.
I also implemented here almost all of the newly-learned stuff and a few of my own experiments :) 

You can see this website here: [https://dorotapindur.github.io/homepage/](https://dorotapindur.github.io/homepage/).
